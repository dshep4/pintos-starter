@macro localmachines{}
The COS 450 ``officially supported'' Pintos development machines are the Linux
machines in the Scince Building managed by the CS Department, as described on
the @uref{http://usm.maine.edu/cos/unix-lab-guide, ,
CS department webpage}.
@end macro

@macro localpathsetup{}
Under @command{bash}, USM's login shell, you can do so
with this command:
@example
export PATH=@value{localpintosbindir}:$PATH
@end example
@noindent
It is a good idea to add this line to the @file{.basshrc} file
in your home directory.  Otherwise, you'll have to type it every time
you log in.
@end macro

@macro localcrossbuild{}
Watch the commands executed during the build.  On the Linux machines,
the ordinary system tools are used.
@end macro

@macro localhonorcodepolicy{}
In the context of USM's COS 450 course, please respect the spirit
and the letter of the honor code by refraining from reading any homework
solutions available online or elsewhere.  Reading the source code for
other operating system kernels, such as Linux or FreeBSD, is allowed,
but do not copy code from them literally.  Please cite the code that
inspired your own in your design documentation.
@end macro

@macro localcredits{}
@c none needed
@end macro

@macro localcvspolicy{}
Instead, we recommend integrating your team's changes early and often,
using a source code control system such as GIT (@pxref{GIT}).
This is less likely to produce surprises, because everyone can see
everyone else's code as it is written, instead of just when it is
finished.  These systems also make it possible to review changes and,
when a change introduces a bug, drop back to working versions of code.
@end macro

@macro localcodingstandards{}
All of you should have taken a class like COS 160, so we expect you to be
familiar with some set of coding standards such as
@uref{http://people.usm.maine.edu/houser/cos450,
, USM CS Coding Standards}. Even if you've taken COS 160, we recommend
reviewing that document.  We expect code at the ``Peer-Review Quality''
level described there.
